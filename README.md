# Library Laboratory Guide

Through the years I've had the need to perform several procedures while developing libraries using Git and Github for Python. Normally, this procedures are performed rarely, sometimes only once in a libraies lifetime, like creating a PiPy or Conda-forge library. Thus it is difficult to remember and save in my memory. Becasue of thie, I have been recolecting all this precdeures and centralizing all this knowledge in a single file so I can rapidly recall what to do. Aa I have found tremendouse use of this list of instructions, I thought that maybe it could be useful for others. So here it is.


# How to use

The instructions are separated by Operating System (OS) and by language. Each OS has a folder, and iside each folder you will find the different available languages for the list. This files are in HyperText Markup Language (HTML) format using a Sphinx template, so you can access it through your favorite web exlorer and use the serach bar or the index navigator to fins what you need.

All the isntructions and procedures are centralized in the same file, they are not divided in any other category. They are, however, sorted in a secuential way, so if you are creating a library from zero then you may be able to folow the entire list from top to bottom.
